# PRD: OpenClaw Governance Remediation (Feb 23, 2026)

**Status**: Historical remediation snapshot. This is planning context from 2026-02-23, not current runtime authority.

Current truth now lives in active runtime code, the root `OPENCLAW_CONTEXT_ANCHOR.md`, and the current KB truth docs under `docs/OPENCLAW_KB/**`.

The gap statements below should be read as dated audit findings. Some items listed here as missing have since landed in runtime code and now remain useful mainly as historical change context.
Do not use this file as the live remediation contract, the current sprint ladder,
or the current runtime severity baseline. Treat it as preserved historical
change context only.

## 1. Critical Gaps (Must Fix - Blocking)

### Gap 1: Missing Runtime ToolGate
**Claim**: Deny-by-default permission enforcement at skill execution
**Reality**: `toolGate.ts` absent from orchestrator runtime
**Historical note**: This claim is no longer current. `orchestrator/src/toolGate.ts`
and `toolGateStore.ts` now provide durable authorization for governed queue and
skill execution paths. This remains distinct from host-level containment.
**Impact**: No runtime skill access control; relies only on agent-side validation
**Fix**: 
- Create `orchestrator/src/skills/toolGate.ts` (80-120 LOC)
- Enforce agent skill allowlist at runtime before any skill exec
- Audit every denied access attempt

**Severity**: ⚠️ Critical (all permissions are advisory-only today)

---

### Gap 2: Missing Runtime SkillAudit
**Claim**: Startup skill configuration validation gate
**Reality**: `orchestrator/src/skillAudit.ts` doesn't exist; `skills/index.ts` imports broken path
**Historical note**: This claim is no longer current. `workspace/orchestrator/src/skillAudit.ts` now exists, but the runtime wiring question should be treated as partial/deferred rather than resolved by this older PRD.
**Impact**: Invalid/misconfigured skills load silently
**Fix**:
- Create `orchestrator/src/skillAudit.ts` with startup validation (60-100 LOC)
- Validate skill config format, permission matrix completeness
- Hard-fail on misconfiguration

**Severity**: ⚠️ Critical (silent failures on startup)

---

### Gap 3: Orchestrator Not Sole Dispatch Authority
**Claim**: All agent execution routed through orchestrator only
**Reality**: Standalone systemd units exist for `doc-specialist` and `reddit-helper` 
**Impact**: These agents can execute outside queue + audit policy
**Fix**:
- Remove standalone service deployment for both agents
- Route all invocations through orchestrator task triggers
- Update compose/systemd configs to enforce orchestrator-only mode

**Severity**: ⚠️ Critical (governance boundary violated)

---

## 2. High-Priority Gaps (Structural Risk)

### Gap 4: Unknown Task Fallback Accepts Instead of Rejects
**Claim**: Task routing is strict + audited
**Reality**: `taskHandlers.ts` fallback returns success message for unknown types
**Impact**: Invalid task types silently added to queue; no audit trail of failure
**Fix**:
- Change unknown task fallback to explicit error + reject
- Emit security/audit metric for each unknown attempt
- Return structured error (not success message)

**Severity**: 🟡 High (governance visibility gap)

---

### Gap 5: Control Plane Task Allowlist Not Enforced at Enqueue
**Claim**: Only valid tasks accepted into queue
**Reality**: `TaskQueue.enqueue()` has no allowlist guard; internal code can add any task type
**Impact**: Internal queue pollution possible; divergence between API schema and actual queue
**Fix**:
- Add `ALLOWED_TASK_TYPES` enum derived from `taskHandlers` keys
- Validate task type against enum at `TaskQueue.enqueue()` entry point
- Reject unknown task types with audit event before queue acceptance

**Severity**: 🟡 High (queue consistency)

---

### Gap 6: Standalone Services Bypass Audit Traceability
**Claim**: All agent executions traceable to queue task ID
**Reality**: Standalone systemd services can execute agents without queue context
**Impact**: Executions missing from task history + audit logs
**Fix**:
- Make standalone service invocation route through orchestrator (via HTTP POST /api/tasks/trigger)
- Remove direct agent startup capability
- Update systemd units to run healthcheck/monitor mode only, not execution mode

**Severity**: 🟡 High (audit/traceability)

---

## 3. Medium-Priority Gaps (Policy / Operational)

### Gap 7: No API Key Rotation Framework
**Claim**: Auth is secure + rotatable
**Reality**: Static token comparison; no key expiration or rotation mechanism in code
**Historical note**: This claim is no longer current. Runtime auth now includes key rotation metadata checks; remaining risk is operational rotation discipline, not total absence of code support.
**Impact**: Compromised key requires code deployment to remedy
**Fix**:
- Add key versions + expiration timestamps to auth config
- Implement 90-day rotation policy in startup (warn if expired)
- Support multiple active keys during rotation window

**Severity**: 🟠 Medium (ops friction)

---

### Gap 8: Webhook Signature Canonicalization Undocumented
**Claim**: Webhook signatures validated securely
**Reality**: `JSON.stringify(req.body)` used; signing depends on upstream canonicalization
**Impact**: Signature mismatches if upstream changes JSON order
**Fix**:
- Document webhook signing contract with upstream (AlertManager)
- Use canonical JSON representation (sorted keys)
- Add test case with alternate key orderings

**Severity**: 🟠 Medium (reliability)

---

### Gap 9: Integration Tests Mock Runtime Instead of Validating
**Claim**: Full integration tests ensure runtime safety
**Reality**: Tests use fixtures/simulations; don't invoke actual toolGate/middleware
**Impact**: Tests pass while runtime fails
**Fix**:
- Rewrite integration tests to spawn real orchestrator process
- Validate actual middleware chain (auth, validation, rate limits)
- Test denied permission scenarios end-to-end
- Mark old fixture tests as unit tests only

**Severity**: 🟠 Medium (test validity)

---

## 4. Scope Boundaries (OUT OF SCOPE FOR THIS PRD)

❌ **Not included** (separate future work):
- New agent templates or skills
- Feature expansion (new capabilities)
- Performance optimization
- UI/UX enhancements

✅ **Fully scoped** (governance remediation only):
- Runtime permission enforcement
- Audit traceability
- Configuration validation
- Deployment mode enforcement

---

## 5. Implementation Order (Dependency Chain)

```
Phase 1: Implement Runtime Controls
  ├─ skillAudit.ts (prerequisite for all)
  ├─ toolGate.ts (enforces permissions)
  └─ Task allowlist enum (queue validation)

Phase 2: Enforce Governance Boundaries
  ├─ Unknown task fallback → error
  ├─ Remove standalone service deployments
  └─ Route all exec through orchestrator

Phase 3: Validation & Operational Hardening
  ├─ Rewrite integration tests (real runtime)
  ├─ Key rotation framework
  └─ Webhook canonicalization doc + test
```

---

## 6. Success Criteria

- ✅ All 6 invariants now compliant (verified in code + runtime test)
- ✅ Zero claims/reality gaps in OPENCLAW_KB audit re-run
- ✅ Integration tests validate actual runtime controls (not mocks)
- ✅ Unknown task attempts generate audit events + reject
- ✅ No operational path to bypass orchestrator dispatch
- ✅ All skill executions traceable to queue task ID + agent identity

---

## 7. Effort Estimate

| Phase | Gap | Lines | Hours | Risk |
|-------|-----|-------|-------|------|
| 1 | skillAudit.ts | 80 | 1 | Low |
| 1 | toolGate.ts | 120 | 1.5 | Medium |
| 1 | Task allowlist | 40 | 0.5 | Low |
| 2 | Error fallback | 30 | 0.5 | Low |
| 2 | Remove standalone services | 20 | 0.5 | Medium |
| 2 | Orchestrator-only enforcement | 60 | 1 | Medium |
| 3 | Integration test rewrite | 300 | 3 | High |
| 3 | Key rotation framework | 100 | 1.5 | Medium |
| 3 | Webhook canonicalization | 50 | 0.5 | Low |
| **Total** | — | ~780 | **9-10 hours** | — |

---

## 8. Decision Point

**Go / No-Go**: Fix all critical + high gaps before next feature development?

**Recommendation**: ✅ **GO** — Governance foundation is prerequisite for scaling. 9 hours << cost of shipped code with broken permissions.
